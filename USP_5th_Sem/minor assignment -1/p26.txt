(a) If item is nonzero, then multiply product by item and save the result in product ; otherwise, skip the multiplication. In either case, print the value of product.
Solution:
if(item!=0){
    product=product*item;
    printf("%d",product);
}
else{
    printf("%d",product);
}
(b) Store the absolute difference of x and y in y , where the absolute difference is ( x - y ) or (y - x ), whichever is positive. Do not use the abs or fabs function in your solution.
Solution:
if(x>y)
    y=x-y;
else
    y=y-x;
(c) If x is 0 , add 1 to zero count. If x is negative, add x to minus sum. If x is greater than 0 , add x to plus sum.
Solution:
if(x==0)
    zero_count++;
else if(x<0)
    x+minus_sum
else
    x+plus_sum
